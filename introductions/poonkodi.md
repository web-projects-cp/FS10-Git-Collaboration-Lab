Hello Everyone!
Greetings!

My name is Poonkodi Chenniappan. I am from India. Currently I am living in Finland. I have completed a degree, Masters in Computer Applications. I have worked as a Quality Assurance Engineer for nearly two years in Hyderabad, India.

I am interested in Web development So I have completed a Web development course in Metropolia University which includes HTML, CSS, Javascript and Basics of React. In this course I have done small webpage projects.

I have a son who is nine years old and he is interested in playing tennis. Most of the time I spend time with my son. My husband is always motivating me to my career.

I have got a good opportunity to improve my technical skill through integrify. I thank integify for giving me this opportunity.

Thank you to all!
